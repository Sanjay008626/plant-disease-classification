# Introduction
Tea, a globally cherished beverage with a rich historical and cultural significance, holds a crucial position in the agricultural sector. Camellia sinensis, the tea plant, serves as the primary source of this beloved beverage, providing a cornerstone for the economies of several countries and livelihoods for countless individual.However, the cultivation of tea plants is often challenged by a myriad of diseases that significantly hamper the yield and quality of tea leaves, consequently impacting the economic viability of tea production and the global tea market. Identifying these diseases accurately and in a timely manner has thus become a critical imperative for the sustainability and productivity of tea cultivation.Traditional methods of disease identification, heavily reliant on manual inspection by trained agronomists, have long been the primary approach. 
# Objectives
The primary goal is to develop a robust and accurate deep learning model based on the ResNet architecture. This model will serve as the cornerstone of our disease classification system.To train and evaluate our model effectively, we will create a comprehensive dataset of tea plant images. This dataset will cover a wide range of diseases and be meticulously annotated, providing the necessary input for our machine learning system.Fine-tuning is essential to optimize the ResNet model's performance. We will focus on enhancing the model's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying tea plant diseases.Finally, we will explore the scalability and adaptability of our system. This includes assessing its potential use in other crop disease classification tasks and various agricultural sectors, extending the impact of our work beyond tea plantations.
# OneAPI
The oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit [1] is implemented using the oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL), a powerful machine learning library that helps speed up big data analysis. oneDAL is an extension of IntelÂ® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL) and is a part of oneAPI. oneAPI is a cross-industry, open, standards-based unified programming model that delivers a common developer experience across accelerator architectures.
# OneAPI Optimization
I have used oneAPI which provides enhancement to ML models using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations. Optimizing machine learning models using Intel's OneAPI involves focusing on key areas to enhance overall performance. First and foremost, leverage optimized libraries such as oneDAL to efficiently execute deep learning operations. Implement the Data Parallel C++ (DPC++),python programming model to tap into parallel processing capabilities across diverse architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators. Explore offloading computationally intensive tasks to GPUs using OneAPI's capabilities, leading to significant speed improvements. Prioritize memory optimization strategies, including data layout optimizations, minimizing data movement, and utilizing cache-friendly data structures. Investigate quantization techniques to reduce precision and computational demands. Additionally, consider model pruning to eliminate unnecessary parameters and connections, thus streamlining computations. Use profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks effectively. Finally, stay updated with the latest software and driver releases and engage with Intel's support resources for targeted guidance in optimizing specific areas of your machine learning workflow.
# Processed System
The project focuses on using the ResNet architecture for the classification of diseases affecting tea plants based on images of their leaves. Beginning with the collection and annotation of a diverse dataset that includes healthy tea plants and various disease conditions, the project aims to build a robust model capable of distinguishing between different disease types. The chosen ResNet variant, such as ResNet-18 or ResNet-34, is implemented using a deep learning framework, with potential customization to suit the specifics of tea plant disease classification. The model undergoes training with data augmentation techniques to enhance its robustness and generalization. Hyperparameter tuning and validation on separate datasets contribute to optimizing the model's performance. Following successful training and validation, the model is evaluated on a held-out test dataset to assess its generalization capabilities. Ultimately, the trained model can be deployed for practical disease classification in tea plants, with considerations for ongoing monitoring, maintenance, and potential interpretability of the model's decisions.
